# waterheater
A high-tech, low-tech wood fired water heater monitor.  High-tech because 
it's a thing on the Internet of Things (tm).  Low-tech because it works for
a redneck like me.

This arduino project features analog reading of two 10k thermistor sensors
(one top and one bottom) to read the water temperature, and a 30mV 
thermocouple in the stack to determine fire status.
